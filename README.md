# titanic-mlp-classifier
Neural network that classifies if somebody survived or died in the titanic disaster

So this is some code I wrote for a Kaggle machine learning competition.
I decided to upload it to GitHub so it would show off some more recent code of mine.
This code could theoretically be reused for any classifier with a few tweaks, and a rewriting of the data importing and cleaning section.
